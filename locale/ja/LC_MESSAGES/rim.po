" (target), that is, whether you are providing or receiving help. If you "
"want to receive help, simply press the \"Receive help now\" button above."

"Controller. RIM will establish the connection and start the voice "
"conversation if necessary."

"speakers."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During the session, the technician presses Windows+Shift+Backspace on "
"Windows, or Option+Shift+Backspace on macOS, to open the RIM menu. On "
"this menu, the technician can minimize the session, flip the session so "
"the end-user can watch and control the technician’s machine, launch "
"accessibility on the Target, request the end-user's permission to gain "
"unattended access to this target machine, or close the session."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the end-user’s machine isn’t running a screen reader, the technician "
"can start our remote accessibility module that allows only the technician"
" to hear speech output. For this to work, the technician must be running "
"NVDA on their own machine if they're on Windows, or VoiceOver if they're "
"on macOS."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also transfer files or folders between the two machines. To do "
"this, simply use File Explorer on Windows, or the Finder on macOS, to "
"copy one or more files or folders onto the clipboard on one end. Then on "
"the controller end, open the RIM menu and choose the option to transfer "
"the file or files. When that's done, a folder containing the transferred "
"file or files will open on the receiving end. Of course, copying and "
"pasting text across machines also works."
