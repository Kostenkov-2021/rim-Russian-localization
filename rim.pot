"Before using this software for the first time, Apple requires us to ask for "

"depend on whether you are providing or receiving help. We will provide step "

"help."

"RIM has a single installer, regardless of whether you are playing the role "
"of the technical support provider(controller) or the remote end-user "
"(target), that is, whether you are providing or receiving help. If you want "
"to receive help, simply press the \"Receive help now\" button above. Then "
"all you need to do is enter the key word provided by the Controller. RIM "
"will establish the connection and start the voice conversation if necessary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are providing help, you will need to click the “Provide remote help "
"now” button below and log into the RIM service. The first time you log in, "
"we’ll need to verify your email address and phone number."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you’re ready to help someone, direct the person needing help to visit "

"The two sides are connected. In addition to the remote desktop session, a "
"voice conversation can be started optionally at the beginning or later in "
"the session. Neither the Controller or Target need to be waring headphones "
"during a remote session. Feel free to use your computer’s speakers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Controller can hear any audio output on the end-user’s machine, "
"including not only any screen reader the end-user may be running, but also "
"other applications. Sighted or low-vision technicians can also see the "
"end-user’s screen. Keyboard and mouse input work as expected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During the session, the technician presses Windows+Shift+Backspace on "
"Windows, or Option+Shift+Backspace on macOS, to open the RIM menu. On this "
"menu, the technician can minimize the session, flip the session so the "
"end-user can watch and control the technician’s machine, launch "
"accessibility on the Target, request the end-user's permission to gain "
"unattended access to this target machine, or close the session."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the end-user’s machine isn’t running a screen reader, the technician can "
"start our remote accessibility module that allows only the technician to "
"hear speech output. For this to work, the technician must be running NVDA "
"on their own machine if they're on Windows, or VoiceOver if they're on "
"macOS."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also transfer files or folders between the two machines. To do "
"this, simply use File Explorer on Windows, or the Finder on macOS, to copy "
"one or more files or folders onto the clipboard on one end. Then on the "
"controller end, open the RIM menu and choose the option to transfer the "
"file or files. When that's done, a folder containing the transferred file "
"or files will open on the receiving end. Of course, copying and pasting "
"text across machines also works."
